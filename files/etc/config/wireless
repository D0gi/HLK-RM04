###	Use these to connect to your router

config wifi-iface
        option device   radio0
        option network  'homelan'
        option mode     'sta'
#       option wds      '1'	#	This might not work on many devices as both ends sometimes implement it differently
        option ssid     'Radulescu'
        option encryption 'psk2'

###	Use these to listen for connections.
###	In our build we don't even include a DHCP server!
###	This actually could interfere with the signal so it's disabled by default
